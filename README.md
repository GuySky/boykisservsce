A VSCode extension created by Desyatov Vladimir Vladimirovich (M3107, 384231) ((for fun :p))

This extension manages to create a window in activity bar, which has some basic button functions to spawn windows with ASCII-art ;D

You can either download whole source code and build it for yourself or just download boykisser-0.0.1.vsix and add it as an extension in the extensions manager in VSCode.

Basically the extension uses VSCode API to create a few windows here and there, control them and play around.

===

## Now a little deeper:
When you've downloaded the extension, a small star will appear under all your icons on the active pannel. If you click it, you'll see a button, which says "Click me <3". And as soon as you click it, it's gonna spawn a window with an ASCII art of... Whoops, spoilers) Anyway

It can be useful if you, following source code as a ref, make more buttons which could spawn different windows. In js lang you can even make animations on these windows to customize your IDE or even optimize your workflow!

However, for now it's all of its functionality.
